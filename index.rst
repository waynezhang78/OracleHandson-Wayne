This workshop is for quick apply Oracle best practice step by step base on Nutanix Oralce on AHV best practice for SE or partner training.
I found most of technical persons read the best practice guide but still can’t apply these parameter or settings.
That why I wrote this workshop material for who doesn't have any Oracle technical background but still want apply Oracle best practice on Nutanix for POC or testing purpose.
It’s a quick way to apply those best practice. I still suggest you must read our Nutanix best guide to understand why we need to change some parameters and configuration to get best performance.
After you learned, You can apply this to your POC or when customer want running Oracle on Nutanix.
In this guide , we didn't mention about how to install a Oracle database.
If you want learn how to installed a Oracle database , you can find ”how to” in these links.
